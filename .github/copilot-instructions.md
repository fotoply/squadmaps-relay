The README.md contains basic information about the project and should be updated with any significant changes or new features.

Avoid removing old methods or comments unless they are clearly incorrect or redundant.

If a method is replaced with a new one simply remove the old one, don't comment it out.

Reformat the file after making changes to ensure consistent code style.

After completing a task you may increment the version number at the top of the script if appropriate.

When using icons always use a Font Awesome icon.

After completing a task do not proceed to the next task until the user has verified that the previous task is complete
and functional.

You may use IntelliJ tools if they are deemed suitable, but they should be used sparingly as they require user confirmation.
